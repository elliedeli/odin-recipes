    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This white queso is similar to white cheese sauces served in Mexican restaurants. This recipe is kid-friendly, quick, and delicious! The heat can be adjusted by adding chili pepper or more cayenne pepper. Use as a warm dip for tortilla chips or sauce for nachos, and many other Mexican dishes.</p>
